# Customer Churn Prediction (IOD): Project Overview 
* Created predictive model that predicts whether a customer will churn (F1 0.9274) to help banks intervene and prevent churn.
* Data sourced from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers)
* Cleaned data and encoded relevant variables for model building
* Compared a range of state-of-the-art Machine Learning Models (CatBoost, XGBoost, AdaBoost, Random Forest)
* Optimised CatBoost using GridSearchCV to reach the best model
* Consolidated information into PowerPoint Slide Deck for presentation.

## Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.8  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, catboost, xgboost, imblearn, custom code

## Data Cleaning
The data source from Kaggle was very clean, and minimal cleaning was required. Pre-processing was required, which was done prior to model building.
